<h2>Academic background</h2>
<p>I did my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences. So cells and some experimental gadgets were my toys LOL. Hopefully I can add programming to my toy list after this course.</p>
<p>That being said, I have 0 experience in almost any kinds of programming languages. What I used todo is using UI softwares. Really willing to learn from you!</p>
